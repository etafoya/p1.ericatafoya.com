<h1>Erica Tafoya</h1>
<p>I was born in San Francisco, CA and raised in Montana. I went to school at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. After receiving a master's degree in Diplomacy & International Relations, I moved to Washington, DC. While there, I got married and had a son. In 2010, we moved to Manchester, UK, where we spent a year and a half. </p>
<p>I am now happily settled in Denver, CO, working as a front-end web developer. My real love (in addition to my son), however, is Human Design. I am studying to become a Human Design anaylst in the hopes of combining it with some form of therapy.</p>
<p>My code editor is Dreamweaver.</p>
